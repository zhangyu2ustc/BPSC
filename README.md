# Brain parcellation using structural covariance


Basically, structural covariance means that brain regions show similar patterns of anatomical features across subjects, for instance grey matter density or cortical thickness. These co-varied brain regions might be involved in the same brain networks and served similar brain functions. Researchers have shown that different brain systems, for instance motor, auditory, visual and language systems, showed distinctive anatomical covariance patterns (Zielinski et al. 2008), but at the same time merged into different brain networks based on the anatomical features (Alexander-Bloch et al. 2010). Here, we tried to illustrate that the structural covariance patterns could also be used to parcellate brain areas and construct a new brain atlas.
